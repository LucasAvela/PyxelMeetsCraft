# ðŸ§± Pixel Meets Craft

A retro-style, fake-3D Minecraft-like game built with [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), the Python engine for pixel-perfect 8-bit games. This project uses cleverly designed sloped block sprites to simulate depth and perspective in a fully 2D environment.

## ðŸŽ® About the Game

**Pixel Meets Craft** is a sandbox building game inspired by Minecraft's blocky style â€” but reimagined in a retro pixel art world. It gives the illusion of 3D by using angled tiles and rendering tricks, creating a unique visual experience while maintaining simplicity and performance.

Everything you see is actually 2D, but built with a layered tilemap that creates a strong illusion of height, depth, and volume.

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

This project started as an experiment in using **2D rendering** to simulate **3D perspective**, inspired by isometric and voxel games. Pyxel provides a clean and nostalgic platform for building such an idea with performance in mind.

The goal is to make a lightweight Minecraft-like experience thatâ€™s accessible, easy to modify, and fun to build on.
